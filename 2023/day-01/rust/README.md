# 2023 Day 01

In my continued attempt to learn rust, I decided to complete 2023's advent of code in rust. Please excuse the horrible rust code, I'm learning! 

I originally tried to solve this with regex, however the standard rust library does not support look-ahead regex. Granted, it would not be an interesting problem if you could just use regex anyway. Given this issue, I converted both solutions to a naive string searching pattern.
